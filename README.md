# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis
Amazon Sales Data Analysis with Python using the libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

In this project, I worked on:
✔️ Cleaning and preprocessing real-world data
✔️ Handling missing values and correcting data types
✔️ Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
✔️ Analyzing relationships between product prices and ratings
✔️ Creating visualizations to identify trends and patterns

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
🔹 Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
🔹 Matplotlib for data visualization
🔹 Writing clean, structured analysis in Jupyter/Google Colab

If you’re a beginner in Data Analytics or Data Science, I highly recommend going through the notebook to understand how basic data analysis is performed step by step using a real dataset.
I’m continuously learning and improving, and I’d really appreciate any feedback or suggestions from the community.
